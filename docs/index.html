<h2>DESCRIPTION </h2>
<p>The Basic Meeting List Toolbox (BMLT, hereafter) is a very powerful client/server system that has been written for a very specific purpose, for a very specific clientele.</p>
<p>It is designed to track and locate Narcotics Anonymous meetings, which are regularly- scheduled weekly, recurring events.</p>
<p>The intended clientele is Narcotics Anonymous Service bodies. They implement a BMLT server, and provide the server to other NA Service bodies.</p>
<p>You can find out way too much about the BMLT on <a href="https://bmlt.app">the BMLT Documentation Site</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/BMLT_NA">You can follow us on Twitter for release announcements</a>.</p>
<p>This project is the "root" server for the BMLT. It is the "server" part of the BMLT "client/server" architecture.</p>
<p>The project is actually several years old. It is currently hosted on <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/bmlt-enabled/BMLT-Root-Server">Follow this link to see the Current GitHub repository.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://bitbucket.org/bmlt/bmlt-root-server/">Follow this link to see the legacy BitBucket repository.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/MAGSHARE/BMLT-Root-Server">Follow this link to see the legacy GitHub repository.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/comdef/">Follow this link to see the legacy antediluvian repository on SourceForge.</a>.</p>
<p>I decided to start new on <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>, as opposed to bringing over the SourceForge project, in order to reduce disk space usage, and because it's a pain to rearrange a standard SVN structure to Git.</p>
<p>NOTE: The repository origin has been transferred to <a href="http://bitbucket.org">Bitbucket</a>! <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> is now only archival (ends at version 2.0.2).</p>
<h2>REQUIREMENTS </h2>
<p>The entire system is written in PHP, JavaScript, XHTML and CSS. Most of the code is PHP.</p>
<p>PHP 5.6 or above is required to establish a root server, and 5.0 or above for a satellite.</p>
<p>For more information about server requirements, see <a href="https://bmlt.app/specific-topics/server-requirements/">the page on Server Requirements</a></p>
<h2>INSTALLATION </h2>
<p>You set up a root server as the central database and administration area for a BMLT implementation, but most people access it through what we call "satellite servers." These satellites comprise the "client" part of the BMLT "client/server" architecture.</p>
<p>For instructions on installing the root server, see <a href="https://bmlt.app/installing-a-new-root-server/">the page on installing a new Root Server</a></p>
<h2>CHANGELIST </h2>
<p>***Version 2.13.4* ** <em>- UNRELEASED</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Meetings are now published by default when creating a new meeting. To change this back to default to unpublished you would need to add the following to your <code>auto-config.inc.php</code>.<ul>
<li><code>$default_meeting_published = false;</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added server version to login screen.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.13.3* ** <em>- July 7, 2019</em></p>
<ul>
<li>When saving a change to a meeting, the edit screen for that meeting is no longer closed. This makes it easier for the user to keep their place in the user interface.</li>
<li>When the published checkbox is unchecked in the meeting editor UI, a note is displayed: "Unpublishing a meeting indicates a temporary closure. If this meeting has closed permanently, please delete it."</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.13.2* ** <em>- July 4, 2019</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where the wrong service body could be displayed in the "Service Body Administration" section of the Admin UI when a Service Body Administrator is the Primary Admin of only one service body.</li>
<li>Service Body Admins can now use the new "Server Administration" section of the UI, allowing them to upload the spreadsheet returned by NAWS to batch update the World IDs for their meetings.</li>
<li>Removed the "Delete Permanently" capability when deleting meetings as a Server Admin. The "Delete Permanently" checkbox caused a meeting to be deleted with no change record. Abuse of this feature made it difficult for NAWS to reconcile its meeting list with the BMLT. All deleted meetings now result in a change record.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.13.1* ** <em>- July 2, 2019</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Semantic Administration is now enabled by default on install wizard.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug with JSONP endpoint emoting incorrect mime type.</li>
<li>Added format_type to the definition of formats. This allows satellites to distinguish between classes of formats, and handle them differently (e.g. languages displayed with flags).<ul>
<li>The following types are defined:<ul>
<li>&lsquo;'FC1&rsquo; =&gt; 'Meeting Format (Speaker, Book Study, etc.)',<code> -</code>'FC2' =&gt; 'Location Code (Wheelchair Accessible, Limited Parking, etc.)',<code> -</code>'FC3' =&gt; 'Special Interest and Restrictions (Mens Meeting, LGTBQ, No Children, etc.)',<code> -</code>'O' =&gt; 'Attendance by non-addicts (Open, Closed)',<code> -</code>'LANG' =&gt; 'Language'`</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added the ability to specify languages for formats that are not included in the languages for which the server admin console has been translated. This lightweight style of adding languages allows meeting lists to be generated if a satellite has been translated (much less work than the entire server admin).<ul>
<li>To do this you would add an additional setting in your <code>auto-config.inc.php</code><ul>
<li>Ex. &lsquo;$format_lang_names = ['fa&rsquo;=&gt;'Farsi'];`</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added database migration system with database schema versioning, and added dbVersion to GetServerInfo endpoint.</li>
<li>Formats are now sorted alphabetically in the root server administration, as well as NAWS format dropdown.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.13.0* ** <em>- April 28, 2019</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Added new "Server Administration" section to the user interface, allowing server admins to upload the spreadsheet returned by NAWS to batch update the World IDs for meetings.</li>
<li>Added warning when attempting to delete a service body to remove any existing meetings or transfer them to another service body so they don't become "orphaned".</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where calculated field <code>root_server_uri</code> would get written to the database and subsequently reported in change history.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.12.8* ** <em>- April 24, 2019</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed some PHP warnings in the POI/CSV, KML, and GPX endpoints.</li>
<li>Fixed some PHP warnings in the GetChanges endpoint.</li>
<li>Fixed some PHP warnings that occurred when saving meetings.</li>
<li>Fixed some PHP warnings in the server_admin_strings.</li>
<li>Fixed a PHP warning with headers being sent twice for NAWS dump.</li>
<li>Fixed a PHP warning in the GetFieldValues endpoint.</li>
<li>Fixed a PHP warning that occurred when modifying a user.</li>
<li>Replaced deprecated PHP function <code>ereg</code> with <code>preg_match</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.12.7* ** <em>- April 21, 2019</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The installation wizard now has more intuitive error handling.</li>
<li>The installation wizard now writes <code>auto-config.inc.php</code> automatically, so you don't have to.</li>

<ul>
<li>Added user name to sign out link for the administration UI.</li>
<li>Added the ability to display a fixed set of counties when editing meetings in a dropdown menu rather than a freeform text field with a new <code>$meeting_counties_and_sub_provinces</code> setting.</li>
<li>Added Danish translations.</li>
<li>Fixed some minor issues with the /html/ endpoint.</li>
<li>Fixed some more issues with running the root server behind a reverse proxy.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.12.4* ** <em>- December 15, 2018</em></p><ul>
<li>Made sorting case-insensitive, for users and service bodies.</li>
<li>When creating URLs for static content, the HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PORT and HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO headers are now inspected for determining the port and protocol.</li>
<li>Added sorting to semantic workshop for service bodies and formats.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.12.3* ** <em>- December 7, 2018</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The service bodies list under the "Search For Meetings Tab" in the "Meeting Editor" is now sorted.</li>

<li>Latitude and longitude input boxes are now read only instead of disabled, allowing users to select and copy the calculated values.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where static files in the client_interface/html/ endpoint were not being included.</li>
<li>The German translations for the administration UI were updated.</li>
<li>The "Set Map to Address" button in the single meeting editor was removed, as it no longer provides value to the workflow.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.12.2* ** <em>- November 22, 2018</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where formats could be wrong in a NAWS Dump for servers that were combined using lettuce.</li>

</ul>
<p>***Version 2.11.0* ** <em>- September 28, 2018</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Added the ability to allow Service Body Administrators to edit their users.</li>
<li>Added cache busting for the server admin JavaScript, eliminating the need to clear the browser cache after an upgrade.</li>
<li>There was an exceedingly rare bug in the history display. If a user had been changed for a Service body, and the previous user had been deleted, it would hang the history display.</li>
<li>Added support for disabling the forced port in the include URIs. Some VM servers misrepresent the ports when forcing SSL.</li>
<li>Improved code commenting.</li>
<li>Fixed an inconsistency in time format of defaults for duration time</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.10.7* ** <em>- July 27, 2018</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Improved the password hashing algorithm.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.10.6* ** <em>- July 14, 2018</em></p><ul>
<li>Service body and user dropdowns on the admin interface are sorted alphabetically</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where leading zeros were being left on meeting time for JSONP interface.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with the case for the installer wizard generation of the "$gKey" variable (should be "$gkey").</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.10.5* ** <em>- April 19, 2018</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The Italian localization was missing the label and default text for the Helpline field in the Service Body Editor. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>Made a fix for the Italian translation to avoid text overlap.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where stricter PHP 7 settings were causing problems with user admin.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.10.4* ** <em>- April 3, 2018</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Added the capability to specify multiple Service bodies in the JSONP interface.</li>
<li>Fixed an urgent bug caused by the new format hack.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.10.3* ** <em>- April 2, 2018</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Added the Root Server URI and shared code list to the XSD (XML Schema).</li>
<li>Added the Root Server URI to the available fields returned by the server info.</li>
<li>Added a list of format shared codes to the available fields returned by the server info.</li>
<li>Added <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_jsonp.asp">JSONP</a> as a choice for the Semantic Interface. This allows the use of the BMLT on site-builder systems, like <a href="https://www.wix.com">Wix</a> and <a href="https://www.weebly.com">Weebly</a>.</li>
<li>Fixed an old issue, where having two different formats with the same key could mess up in the meeting editor. HOWEVER, we should not allow this to occur.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.10.2* ** <em>- March 24, 2018</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Added provision for including Service body contact emails in the semantic response. This requires adding "$g_include_service_body_email_in_semantic = TRUE;" to the auto-config.inc.php file.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.10.1* ** <em>- March 14, 2018</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Added the Root Server URI as a new field to format results. This will help with the new <a href="http://archsearch.org/sandwich/">Sandwich</a> aggregator.</li>
<li>If someone enters '24:00:00' or '00:00:00' as the time (midnight), then it gets changed to 23:59:00 (11:59 PM). This ensures that "midnight" is always "TONIGHT," not tomorrow AM.</li>
<li>In the semantic interface, I now return an explicit empty array ([]) for JSON, if there are no formats, Service bodies or changes.</li>
<li>Added the API key to the location string lookups. This requires that the API also have Google Geocoding enabled.</li>
<li>The geocoding API calls now go over HTTPS.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.10.0* ** <em>- February 22, 2018</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Added the Root Server URI as a new field to meeting search results. This will help with the new <a href="http://archsearch.org/sandwich/">Sandwich</a> aggregator.</li>
<li>Updated to the latest <a href="https://bmlt.app/specific-topics/bmlt-satellite-base-class/">BMLT Satellite Base Class</a>.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with the initial SQL for the installer wizard, where MySQL was not accepting the default TIMEDATE for users.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug, in which World IDs were not being set when creating new Service bodies.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.9.3* ** <em>- January 4, 2018</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Added code to prevent [some, but not all] severly messed-up long/lat from pooching the whole coverage area.</li>
<li>New Italian Translation.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.9.2* ** <em>- November 12, 2017</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The installer wizard would not run properly in an SSL environment. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>The <a class="el" href="d0/d45/comdef__utilityclasses_8inc_8php.html#aaa05872fe74b9c046831ae47ca39fd02" title="This is a function that returns the results of an HTTP call to a URI. It is a lot more secure than fi...">call_curl()</a> function reported an older UA, which caused some security software to choke. Hopefully, this is fixed.</li>
<li>There was a bug in creating new Service bodies. This is due to the new helpline setting. It has been fixed.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.9.1* ** <em>- October 17, 2017</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The CSV was returning all formats, when it should have been returning a subset. This obviously didn't have a major effect on things, but now it only returns used formats, like JSON and XML.</li>
<li>In some cases, unpublished meetings were being returned in specific field dumps. This has been fixed (affected the [[bmlt_quicksearch]] shortcode).</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.9.0* ** <em>- October 9, 2017</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Added the ability to associate a helpline phone number with a Service body.</li>
<li>Added support for Co-Ops, GSCs and LSCs.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.8.24* ** <em>- September 28, 2017</em></p>
<ul>
<li>In some cases, searches for specific values of a meeting field (like location_municipality) could return unrelated results. This has been fixed.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.8.23* ** <em>- September 24, 2017</em></p>
<ul>
<li>This uses the latest Satellite Base Class (fixes text searches for some non-Roman character sets), and also the latest Semantic Workshop (text searches were not being properly escaped).</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.8.22* ** <em>- August 20, 2017</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Added the NAWS "NS" format. This is actually kind of a worthless format, but NAWS does specify it.</li>
<li>Made the fader banners in the editors a bit more attractive.</li>
<li><p class="startli">Added support for weeks starting on days other than sunday (for sorting). This is accomplished by adding the following line to the auto-config.inc.php file:</p>
<p class="startli"><code>$week_starts_on = 1;</code></p>
<p class="startli">With "1" being Sunday, and "7" being Saturday.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.8.21* ** <em>- June 20, 2017</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Addressed an issue where misconfigured SSL certs could cause problems. I now just pretend they aren't misconfigured, because everyone else does the same.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.8.20* ** <em>- May 26, 2017</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where the coverage area misbehaved around the Prime Meridian.</li>

<li>Fixed a problem where the distances were not being reported in search results.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.8.18* ** <em>- May 18, 2017</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Addressed some PHP warnings.</li>
<li>Added the latest BMLT Satellite Base Class, which supports Region Bias. This also applies to the Root Browser.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.8.17* ** <em>- May 12, 2017</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a coverage area issue that only affected the Hawai'i Region, because it is the only Region that crosses the IDL.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.8.16* ** <em>- May 10, 2017</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The NAWS dump will now no longer send unpublished meetings that don't have World IDs.</li>
<li>Added a "GetCoverageArea" semantic selector. This returns a rectangle, encompassing the meetings served by the server.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.8.15* ** <em>- April 22, 2017</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Changed the install wizard to reflect the new settings added to the auto-config.inc.php file, including the new Google API key.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.8.14* ** <em>- April 12, 2017</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Updated to the latest Semantic Workshop (1.2.1).</li>
<li>Fixed a couple of warnings for undefined variables.</li>
<li>Updated a file inculde to remove POSIX backreference (/../), as security software no likee.</li>
<li>Added the ability to have the default status of meetings set to "OPEN" in the case of NAWS dumps.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that always forced meetings to be listed as "CLOSED" in the NAWS dump.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.8.13* ** <em>- March 30, 2017</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Updated to the latest Satellite Base Class (will not make any difference in operation).</li>
<li>Added a filter for the Service Body Description. People have been pasting junk in there, and it's been causing problems with <a href="https://github.com/radius314/sandwich">the Sandwich project</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.8.12* ** <em>- March 4, 2017</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a rather obscure semantic admin bug that caused problems with meeting names and data when duplicating meetings.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.8.11* ** <em>- February 28, 2017</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug in the new meeting add functionality (semantic admin). This will only affect the <a href="https://bmlt.app/specific-topics/bmltioslib/">BMLTiOSLib</a>.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug, where setting time between 12:01AM (00:01) -&gt; 12:59AM (00:59) would revert to "PM."</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.8.10* ** <em>- January 9, 2017</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Changes needed to return IDs in the Semantic Interface. This is mostly for the new <a href="https://bmlt.app/specific-topics/bmltioslib/">BMLTiOSLib</a> project. Since that project is now alpha, we should release this.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.8.9* ** <em>- January 8, 2017</em></p>
<ul>
<li>There was a minor issue with the 2.8.8 release. Yes, there was data bad enough to make even that ill. Hopefully, it has been addressed.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.8.8* ** <em>- January 8, 2017</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for a new search criteria: "Ends Before or At." This is mostly for the new <a href="https://bmlt.app/specific-topics/bmltioslib/">BMLTiOSLib</a> project.</li>
<li>Fixed an obscure bug in the Change JSON Semantic Response. Some change records had bad data that caused the response format to break JSON validation.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.8.7* ** <em>- January 1, 2017</em></p>
<ul>
<li>No visible changes. This simply includes the latest version of the base class to match the satellites.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.8.6* ** <em>- December 13, 2016</em></p>
<ul>
<li>There was an error in the XSD for deleting meetings. Added a temporary "double-dip" element to the XML response in order to avoid interfering with current implementations. Will delete the "meetingId" element in a later release.</li>
<li>Fixed a legacy error. The name of the Service body field in the meeting change function was wrong. Because of the legacy issue, it can now either be 'service_body_id' or 'service_body_bigint'.</li>
<li>Removed an erroneous meeting name field in the meeting change XML/JSON response.</li>
<li>Fixed an old error in the Semantic Admin, where our special "variable" fields needed an extra layer of parsing.</li>
<li>Fixed an old error in the Semantic Admin, where the formats field was improperly examined.</li>
<li>Added a scrubber to the contact functionality to remove double-newlines, which bork some servers.</li>
<li>Fixed an old bug, where Service bodies without World Committee Codes were being included in the NAWS Dump.</li>
<li>Added an 'unpublished' column to the NAWS export.</li>
<li>If you are logged in as a Service Body Admin, and you get a NAWS export, it will now include unpublished meetings that your login can see (marked as "unpublished"). If you are not logged in, you will not get any unpublished meetings.</li>
<li>Now include the latest Satellite Base Class.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.8.5* ** <em>- November 21, 2016</em></p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>***Version 2.8.0* ** <em>- August 6, 2016</em></p>
<ul>
<li>There were a couple more CSV issues that needed addressing.</li>
<li>Just getting rid of the independent format dump for CSV. It was pretty useless (especially now with the format extraction), and caused problems with printed lists.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that returned improper permissions for non-Service Body Admin logins for the semantic admin.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with the semantic admin, where fields that were empty (and supposed to be) were being ignored.</li>
<li>Beefed up the semantic admin to allow the Service body of a meeting to be switched (a security check is written to ensure the user can admin both bodies).</li>
<li>Added the capability to load a list of deleted meetings in the semantic admin.</li>
<li>Added the ability to request changes across multiple Service bodies in the semantic admin (also applies to deleted meetings).</li>
<li>Added the capability to easily restore deleted meetings in the semantic admin.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the semantic administration that prevented single-Service body admins from creating copies of meetings.</li>
<li>Fixed a couple of warnings that will really only show up in improperly-configured servers.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with saving formats in the new semantic admin.</li>
<li>Added the capacity to rollback meetings to the semantic admin.</li>
<li>Fixed the response from the new meeting semantic admin, so we don't have empty oldValue/newValue elements.</li>

<li>Fixed an issue with the semantic admin that returned the incorrect location for the schema.</li>
<li>Fixed a warning that affected the semantic administration.</li>
<li>Fixed two problems with the installer wizard. One was a JS problem exacerbated by Google changing their API, and the other was caused by the new Italian default formats.</li>

</ul>
<p>***Version 2.7.2* ** <em>- March 13, 2016</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The problem with the previous fix, was that it worked ONLY on direct domains. That's fixed now.</li>
<li>This affects only the Root Browser, or the logged-in (Observer) browser functionality. The rest of the functionality is fine.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.7.1* ** <em>- March 12, 2016</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue found immediately after release with the Observer Browser on some servers that use subdomains that point to the main directory.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.7.0* ** <em>- March 12, 2016</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Added the semantic workshop as a submodule. You can reach it by calling "/main_server/semantic".</li>

</ul>
<p>***Version 2.6.31* ** <em>- February 17, 2016</em></p>
<ul>

<li>Fixed a fairly minor cosmetic bug in the history display, where "&amp;" was being shown as "&amp;amp;" (over-aggressive HTML conversion).</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p>***Version 2.6.23* ** <em>- May 25, 2015</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Fixed an old JavaScript bug in the meeting editor, where the "Create New Meeting" screen would sometimes refuse to enable the save button.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.6.18* ** <em>- March 19, 2015</em></p>
<ul>

<ul>

</ul>
<p>***Version 2.6.15* ** <em>- March 4, 2015</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Made a change in the way the WORLD IDs are returned in the semantic selectors. They are now all properly formatted.</li>
<li>Added a special extra field to XML meeting searches that shows an aggregate for location searches. Useful for maps.</li>

<li>Fixed an XML schema bug (minor).</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.6.14* ** <em>- February 22, 2015</em></p>
<ul>

<li>Fixed a bug in the new semantic responses that reacted badly to commas in data values.</li>
<li>The internal response data from the new semantic calls is now in CSV, which makes it a lot more useful.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.6.12* ** <em>- February 17, 2015</em></p>
<ul>
<li>You are now able to filter for specific formats in the new semantic "GetFieldValues" call by adding a "&amp;specific_formats=1,2,3..." to the parameter list. Also, you can make it an AND (all values) search by adding "&amp;all_formats," which means that the meeting must have all of the given formats to match. Default is "OR," so any one of the formats will trigger a match.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.6.11* ** <em>- February 16, 2015</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Corrected a couple of bugs in the new semantic "GetFieldValues" and "GetFieldKeys" routines. These make the BMLT slightly more awesome.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.6.10* ** <em>- February 16, 2015</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Corrected a bug introduced in the previous release.</li>

</ul>
<p>***Version 2.6.9* ** <em>- February 16, 2015</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Added the capacity to extract the field keys and values semantically (only of use to administrators and semantic interfaces, but extremely powerful).</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.6.8* ** <em>- February 14, 2015 (Happy Valentine's Day!)</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a fairly minor bug in the semantic sorter, in which blank fields were not being sorted at all (they need to be first).</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.6.7* ** <em>- January 31, 2015</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue with the extra fields display in the regular shortcode display details (browser).</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the arbitrary fields were actually creating too many results (browser).</li>
<li>Now hide the distance_in_km/miles parameters in the meeting details (these are internal parameters -browser).</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.6.6* ** <em>- January 26, 2015</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Accidentally removed the text for the NAWS format dump in the Service Body Editor. This has been fixed.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.6.5* ** <em>- January 26, 2015</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Addressed a couple of PHP warnings.</li>
<li>Fixed a nasty bug that could appear in a brand new install. The editor would display as blank after creating the first user.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.6.4* ** <em>- January 13, 2015</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Added the main table fields to the data templates in the semantic admin.</li>
<li>Now allow the language to be forced when instantiating the server object (minimally useful, but should be in place).</li>
<li>Fixed a bug with including files in a non-standard port server.</li>
<li>Fixed a couple of bugs that interfered with deployment on an IIS server.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.6.3* ** <em>- January 11, 2015</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Added some more steps to the the default values for the "auto-range," and expanded it to up to 200 miles.</li>
<li>Added some special SQL sauce for the distance search that makes distance searching more accurate (It now uses a simple <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula">Haversine</a> formula, executed in SQL, in the initial database triage). It will tend to return more meetings, but not a whole ton more. Basically, it just improves the quality of the auto-range. This works well with the new added steps.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.6.2* ** <em>- January 9, 2015</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Tweaked the syntax of this document's changelist to be full markdown, to make it more readable on <a href="http://bitbucket.org">Bitbucket</a>.</li>
<li>Fixed a minor bug, where the initial Service Body Editor NAWS Dump URI was not the new publicly-accessible one.</li>
<li>Greatly simplified the distance search functionality, and now allow it to be customized. This was a request from a largely rural community.</li>
<li>Added a default set of distance ranges for the radius hunt.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.6.1* ** <em>- January 5, 2015</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Made a slight change, so that the formats are not automatically read upon a server instance being created. Instead, we wait until the first call to load them. This prevents them from being loaded in cases where they are not required.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue caused by getting too fancy with radius ranges, and ended up causing problems in the hunt for radius functionality. Need to re-explore this.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.6.0* ** <em>- January 4, 2015</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Changed the NAWS Dump Link in the Service Body Editor to use the new open semantic URI.</li>
<li>Fixed an admin bug, in which meetings that an admin can't edit can be listed in the search results.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug, in which doing searches for meetings by ID would return unpublished meetings.</li>
<li>Added a bit of a kludge to number-only location searches (postal codes). I now append the region bias to the string, as it looks like Google ignores the "region=" parameter.</li>
<li>Created a common URL to the main server (utility function). This allows use of HTTPS and increases overall quality.</li>
<li>The server now returns only the formats used somewhere in the database in response to the semantic "switcher=GetFormats" call.</li>
<li>Continuing to look for places where I can take security measures. Added a few "belt &amp; suspenders" methods, like reloading the user from the DB at every opportunity.</li>
<li>Added the ability to edit meetings via an XML or JSON semantic interface.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.5.3* ** <em>- November 27, 2014 (Happy Thanksgiving!)</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The 2.5.2 "fix" was inadequate. I needed to make the "other" field editing more robust.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.5.2* ** <em>- November 26, 2014</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The 2.5.1 fix exposed another bug in administering the "other" fields.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.5.1* ** <em>- November 26, 2014</em></p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>***Version 2.5.0* ** <em>- November 23, 2014</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for arbitrary fields in meetings (had neglected to support these after the 2.0 release).</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.4.10* ** <em>- October 14, 2014</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed another issue, where simple searches weren't sorting properly (again, overzealous warning compensation).</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.4.9* ** <em>- October 13, 2014</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed another issue, where meeting edits were being ignored (again, overzealous warning compensation).</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.4.8* ** <em>- October 12, 2014</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where low-numbered ASCs and RSCs did not have leading zeroes in the NAWS export, which could cause issues for NAWS.</li>
<li>Fixed a couple of issues with the meeting editors, where inactive anchor elements could cause "page not found" errors.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug, where searching for selected weekdays, formats or languages stopped working.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.4.7* ** <em>- October 9, 2014</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Added an ID to the weekday sections of the simple response (allows easy linking on display pages).</li>
<li>Fixed a number of warnings.</li>
<li>Added some satellite fixes.</li>
<li>Fixed a rather nasty error in the semantic response that could have caused a lot of bad search results. I'm shocked I haven't heard anything.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.4.6* ** <em>- August 19, 2014</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue with apostrophes (') causing problems.</li>
<li>Added a user-agent to the cCURL calls, as some servers filter out cURL calls.</li>
<li>Added a simpler, more direct semantic access to NAWS dumps.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.4.5* ** <em>- July 10, 2014</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Added true Spanish localization to the Root Server.</li>
<li>Added a cookie for storing the selected language.</li>
<li>Tweaked the French localization.</li>
<li>Added a weekday wrapper around block mode simple responses. This allows better integration of search results with CSS.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with double-quotes entered on some servers.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.4.4* ** <em>- June 9, 2014</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug in the semantic interfaces that caused problems with clients. If a meeting had no name, a blank name was returned. It now returns a generic "NA Meeting".</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the administration system that prevented logins after a logout.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.4.3* ** <em>- June 4, 2014</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug introduced by the new code (It only manifested when sending mail, so no one has been affected).</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.4.2* ** <em>- June 4, 2014</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Simplified the response for the test in the email sender.</li>
<li>Made the email generated from contacts a bit more explanatory.</li>
<li>Improved the ability to access the browser and the editor for meetings. This works in conjunction with the email sent from contacts.</li>
<li>Prevent duplicate emails in the contact email.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.4.1* ** <em>- June 1, 2014</em></p>
<ul>

<p>***Version 2.2.3* ** <em>- February 17, 2014</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Fixed a minor warning issue with the simple output.</li>

<li>Added a 'recursive' parameter to the semantic interface. This allows the response to return an entire Service body hierarchy, based on 1 Service body.</li>
<li>Made the search parser a bit more forgiving for Service bodies and weekdays. They are no longer REQUIRED to be arrays, which makes single values easier to specify.</li>

</ul>
<p>***Version 2.0.6* ** <em>- April 27, 2013</em></p>
<ul>
<li>2.0.5 had issues. This should REALLY fix the problem...</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that appeared in some servers, where quotes were escaped. This interfered with administration.</li>

<p>***Version 2.0.4* ** <em>- April 25, 2013</em></p>

<p>***Version 2.0.0* ** <em>- April 13, 2013</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Official release of 2.0.0</li>
<li><p class="startli">There are 3 open bugs in this release that need to be addressed in a near-future "point release": 7) Swedish Language Ümlauts Result In Bad Location Searches This expresses itself in satellite searches, but is probably a root server bug. Search for these cities, using <a href="http://www.nasverige.org/bmlt">the Swedish root server</a>: Malmö Strängnäs Göteborg The searches will not produce expected results.</p>
<p class="startli">8) Localization Needs to support military time in the satellite/root server.</p>
<p class="startli">9) Non-MySQL databases (in particular, Postgres) don't work.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.0b15* ** <em>- April 9, 2013</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Did some work to ensure that strings stored in the database would retain their UTF-8 characteristics.</li>

<ul>
<li>Fixed a JavaScript Issue, where the user level popup was not being correctly set, as a result of the removal of the useless "Editor" level.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.0b10* ** <em>- March 31, 2013</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a JavaScript Issue, where the "dirty confirm" was not being shown in some instances. It is still an issue in a couple (like closing the browser).</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.0b9* ** <em>- March 31, 2013</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a number of small JavaScript bugs that had the annoying habit of interfering with the "dirty" flag for meetings.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.0b8* ** <em>- March 31, 2013</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Removed the useless "trainee" position of "Service Body Editor" as a choice.</li>

</ul>
<p>***Version 2.0b7* ** <em>- March 30, 2013</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p class="startli">Fixed this bug: 6) No Way To Nest Service Bodies 1) Log In as a Server Administrator 2) Open the "Service Body Administration" panel 3) Try to change the hierarchy (the "parent" of the Service body)</p>
<p class="startli">ANOMALY: No way to do it EXPECTED: A popup menu with a choice of other Service bodies that can be used as "parents"</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.0b6* ** <em>- March 30, 2013</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed this bug: If there are no Service bodies (new install), the "Service Bodies" section is not displayed (so no new ones can be created).</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.0b5* ** <em>- March 30, 2013</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p class="startli">Fixed these bugs: 3) No default duration 1) Log in as an Observer 2) Select "Meeting Search" 3) Using the GNYR Dataset, enter "Amagansett, NY" into the text search box</p>
<p class="startli">ANOMALY: A number of meetings show no duration. EXPECTED: A 90-minute duration EXTRA INFO: This should probably be set explicitly in the install wizard</p>
<p class="startli">4) In Observer Meeting Search Mode, Multiple Instances of Hidden Fields Can Be Displayed 1) Log in as an Observer 2) Select "Meeting Search" 3) Using the GNYR Dataset, enter "Amagansett, NY" into the text search box. Ensure that the "This is a location or postcode" checkbox is selected. 4) Hit "GO" 5) Repeat Search (Return to "Specify A New Search," and hit "GO."

<p>***Version 2.0b4* ** <em>- March 29, 2013</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Added full support for observers to browse the database, and view restricted fields in a secure fashion.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.0b3* ** <em>- March 28, 2013</em></p>
<ul>
<li>I realized that I had completely neglected the needs of observers (logged in, but can't edit). I added a basic search for them. Due to the way that the satellites are written, this took about an hour, and represents basically zero risk to the main server admin functionality. In order to use the new browser, you add /client_interface/html to the main_server URI. It will ask you to log in (if you have not already done so), and will present the basic search interface shown in the 3.X version satellites. However, this will require some more work in order to integrate it more completely to the server. Even though the functionality is incomplete, I am making a release in order to ensure that the main server editor functionality was not affected.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.0b2* ** <em>- March 27, 2013</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p class="startli">Fixed this bug: 2) Location Search Fails With Too-Tight Comma 1) Log in as a Service Body Admin (or Server Admin) 2) Open the "Meeting Editor" dropdown 3) Check "This is a Location or PostCode." 4) Enter "Babylon,NY" (Notice no spaces between comma and succeeding character). 5) Click "Search For Meetings"</p>
<p class="startli">ANOMALY: No Search Results EXPECTED: A number of returned meetings EXTRA INFO: Entering "Babylon, NY" (Note space between comma and succeeding character) works.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 2.0b1* ** <em>- March 25, 2013</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p class="startli">Fixed this bug: 1) Open Two Editors Accidentally 1) Log in as a Service Body Admin (or Server Admin) 2) Open the "Meeting Editor" dropdown 3) Do A Meeting Search That Will Yield Results 4) Open the "Edit Meetings" tab 5) Open the top Search Result dropdown 6) Close it 7) Click on the "Create A New Meeting" button (Either click on "Cancel", or the meeting name).</p>
<p class="startli">ANOMALY: Both the Create Meeting And First Result dropdowns open EXPECTED: Only the Create Meeting Editor dropdown opens</p>

<li>Made the "throbber" more stable. It had a tendency to wander around.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 1.3.13* ** <em>- January 28, 2010</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Addressed a minor security issue, in which it was possible to "tailgate" on a prior login. However, it required physical access to a machine with an already established session.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 1.3.12* ** <em>- January 24, 2010</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug, in which the format types were not displaying for a meeting edit.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 1.3.11* ** <em>- January 18, 2010</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Added a visibility parameter to the data fields. Fields can be marked as "invisible" (only admins can see it), Web-only (Does not show up for prints) and Print-only.</li>
<li>Make sure that email contacts are only given to logged-in admins with the right to edit a meeting (hidden, otherwise).</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 1.3.10* ** <em>- January 7, 2010</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a nasty bug that caused string searches to fail if any meetings had the new email contact field filled in.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 1.3.9* ** <em>- January 4, 2010</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Simply added the ability to override the "default" text in the printed PDF lists. This is useful for Service Bodies that use it to create their own lists.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 1.3.8* ** <em>- January 2, 2010</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a newly introduced bug in the formats editor that prevented proper listing of formats in new languages. This is not a data-loss bug, and only affects servers with multilingual formats.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the way the email contact system works.</li>
<li>Cleaned up and vet the email forms a bit. If the email address is not correctly formatted, the meeting, user or Service Body cannot be submitted.</li>
<li>The "return key" submit for the meeting editor did not work. That has been fixed.</li>
<li>Now ensure that unauthorized sessions are destroyed.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 1.3.7* ** <em>- January 1, 2010</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Had to take out <a href="http://us2.php.net/manual/en/function.session-regenerate-id.php">session_regenerate_id()</a>. It caused problems with Chrome.</li>
<li>Fixed a series of sorting bugs in PHP 5.1.X</li>
<li>Removed the strings for the two awkward alerts that are no longer given when adding users or Service Bodies.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the format editor that could result in "clashes" with existing format IDs.</li>
<li>The Add and Delete formats functions now refresh the screen. Much better and more "solid."</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 1.3.6* ** <em>- January 1, 2010</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Removed the inclusion of the Service Body Administrator in the contact email "percolation." Only emails attached to the Service Body will be considered.</li>
<li>Added the ability to associate an email address with an individual meeting. Hopefully, this will be enough to reduce requests to associate personal information with meetings. An email address is less harmful than most, and it is masked by the contact form.</li>
<li>Made the behavior of the Service Body and User Editors a great deal more "natural," with more useful user feedback.</li>
<li>Switched the main throbber to an "NA Radar" throbber. I want to remove the BMLT branding, as that might imply endorsement. I'll leave the root server shortcut icon, as that is so small that it doesn't say much.</li>
<li>Fixed another bug that has been in there since 1.3.3, in which non-server admin users couldn't edit their own account info.</li>
<li>Fixed an old bug in the map search, in which a zoom would result in an extra marker draw.</li>
<li>Made sure that you don't need to specify meeting_key_contains in key searches (It should be true by default).</li>
<li>This release should make the administration far more natural and easy.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 1.3.5* ** <em>- December 29, 2009</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Made the calculation of the radius circle a lot more accurate and speedy. It was having trouble with Northern latitudes. I switched both the JS and PHP to a fast Vincenty calculation.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused user object edits to get ignored (Oops -caused by my centralization of the <a class="el" href="dd/d45/classc__comdef__server.html#aa02af64499b8fb92bd8ce1b9eb671f87" title="Find out if the user is a server admin. ">c_comdef_server::IsUserServerAdmin()</a> function in 1.3.3).</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 1.3.4* ** <em>- December 28, 2009</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Added some styles to the edit screens for meetings that are duplicates or unpublished. Duplicate meetings now have uneditable Duplicate data fields, and a purple background (ugly), and unpublished meetings have a light orange background.</li>
<li>Changed the start time granularity to every five minutes.</li>
<li>Added a couple more fields to the "single meeting URI" filter.</li>
<li>Added a lot of flexibility to the email contact system. It is now possible to set a "percolate up" email address, or a separate email address in the Service Body to receive meeting contact emails.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused the meeting editor to crash if a Service Body was deleted, when it was mentioned in a change record.</li>
<li>Made the meeting editor place the copy data item on top.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug, in which the proper copy style was not being updated in the background list when a copy was edited without removing the copy data item.</li>
<li>Switched the displayed strings to use a centralized function.</li>
<li>Added some indicators in single meeting (More Details) windows, when the meeting is unpublished and/or a duplicate.</li>
<li>Added some stripslashes() calls to the text being stored to the database for meetings.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 1.3.3* ** <em>- December 22, 2009</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that all undeleted meetings are restored unpublished.</li>
<li>Added the capability to duplicate a meeting (Creates a new meeting that is an exact duplicate of an existing one). This is done in the "bulk list operations," and results in purple stripes. Purple meetings cannot be published until the "Duplicate" data field has been removed.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the server meeting ID count wasn't being done properly. It made it possible to have meeting IDs clash when resurrecting deleted meetings. So far, this has not come up.</li>
<li>Made it so that the proper server <a class="el" href="dd/d45/classc__comdef__server.html#aa02af64499b8fb92bd8ce1b9eb671f87" title="Find out if the user is a server admin. ">c_comdef_server::IsUserServerAdmin()</a> is used to check all users.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug, in which restoring a deleted meeting from the Server Admin account would leave the permanent delete line behind.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug, in which warnings could appear in the format sorter, because I didn't check properly to make sure the arrays were valid first.</li>
<li>Tweaked the security just a wee bit more, by forcing a user object reload prior to ANY request for its level. Prevents "live object" shenanigans.</li>
<li>Added titles to the unpublished rows and the disabled publish button that explain what is going on.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug, in which unnamed meetings resulted in "null" being displayed in the map info windows. Now, "NA Meeting" is displayed.</li>
<li>Fixed a possible security issue, in which login details could be passed beyond the initial login in cleartext (oops).</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in which meeting editors were not allowed to delete unpublished meetings (They should be allowed to do so, and also undelete them).</li>
<li>Fixed a couple more bugs around NA meetings without names.</li>
<li>Updated the documentation to show the current structure of the BMLT.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 1.3.2* ** <em>- December 19, 2009</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a rather annoying inaccuracy in the map circle when zoomed out.</li>
<li>Got some basic "bulk edit" operations working. From list view, you can now publish, unpublish or delete meetings in bulk, by using checkboxes.</li>
<li>Made it so that longitude and latitude values can now be entered directly as text.</li>
<li>Reduced the number of session regenerators, because some browsers drop logins during AJAX sessions.</li>
<li>Added the ability for Server Administrators to make meeting deletions permanent.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 1.3.1* ** <em>- December 13, 2009</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Added some styles to the various additional editor checkboxes in the Service Body Editor. Bold are Service Body Editors, and italic are Meeting List Editors.</li>
<li>Added the ability to sort the format codes in the standard meeting editor.</li>
<li>Changed the styles for the format codes in the meeting editor, so the default formats are red (replaces the asterisk).</li>
<li>Removed the new meeting confirm alert, just to try to reduce the number of clicks involved.</li>
<li>Added a new AJAX throbber to the Create New Meeting screen, and disable the button while the editor is up, in order to try to reduce errors.</li>
<li>Disable the publish checkbox if the long/lat has not been set.</li>
<li>Added an extra layer of security to drop out of the editor if the meeting is published, and the editor is not a Service Body Admin.</li>
<li>Cleaned up a bunch of deprecated PHP functions to reduce PHP warnings to only a few that concern the clock.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 1.3.0* ** <em>- December 5, 2009</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Simple release with no changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 1.3B0* ** <em>- November 27, 2009</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Added handling of "published" meetings, including a silent database update.</li>
<li>Added an empty auto-config.inc.php.rename file.</li>
<li>Made some substantial changes to the way that the meeting changes are displayed. They now give an itemized report of the exact changes made.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that would not have shown up until localization was attempted (one of the buttons in the meeting editor had a hardcoded name).</li>
<li>Added a submit button to the new data field fieldset. This greatly enhances the meeting edit workflow; especially for new meetinggs.</li>
<li>Fixed a couple of really lame, stoopid bugs in the format editor. I got my _GET and _POST mixed up. Duh.</li>
<li>Fixed some CSS and JS issues that caused complaints with validators.</li>
<li>Added the ability to sort the formats in the format editor.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the way the meeting object serializes data. The weekday was being reduced by 1. The fix may affect old changes. Check the weekday if you do a revert.</li>
<li>Changed the role of the Meeting List Editor, so they can't publish meetings, or work on published meetings. They can't delete meetings either.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 1.2.22* ** <em>- November 25, 2009</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an admin error, in which you are not allowed to assign meetings to Service bodies that don't already have meetings.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 1.2.21* ** <em>- November 15, 2009</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a JavaScript error that would sometimes result in the advanced tab becoming disabled, in some browsers. It should be fixed now. Really.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 1.2.20* ** <em>- November 14, 2009</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a JavaScript error that would sometimes result in the advanced tab becoming disabled, in some browsers.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 1.2.19* ** <em>- November 11, 2009</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The style for the new GO button was messed-up. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>Removed a redundant empty script element from the header.</li>
<li>Sped up the loading for satellites that have an AJAX check.</li>
<li>Fixed a nasty JavaScript bug that showed up in Firefox.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 1.2.18* ** <em>- November 10, 2009</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&amp;aid=2895410&amp;group_id=228122&amp;atid=1073410">a nasty bug</a>, in which auto-radius within very dense urban areas could fail.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 1.2.17* ** <em>- November 9, 2009</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Added an extra "GO" button to the top of the Advanced Search screen. This enhances usability.</li>
<li>Now hide "dead" meetings from all but the admins.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 1.2.16* ** <em>- November 6, 2009</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&amp;aid=2891653&amp;group_id=228122&amp;atid=1073410">a bug</a>, in which a nonfunctional PDF popup was displayed on the root server.</li>
<li>Hardcoded the root PDF directory. This wasn't really a security breach, but it is possible to write bad URIs that could give ugly results. It's also a good idea to be anal by habit.</li>
<li>Added a note to the Advanced Tab formats and Service Bodies to hold the cursor over the items.</li>
<li>Made some tweaks to the styling and text of the search specification form to increase usability.</li>
<li>Fixed <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=2893015&amp;group_id=228122&amp;atid=1073410">a bug</a>, in which the advanced marker would disappear after a zoom.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 1.2.15* ** <em>- November 3, 2009</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Increased the minimum zoom for the "two-click zoom," because zoom 8 is still a bit too wide.</li>
<li>Added a field to the auto-config.inc.php file, that allows you to disable the "auto zoom-in" feature, so every click results in meetings found. This is good for rural areas.</li>
<li>Added on-root-server PDF generation. This allows satellites to use the PDF dumps <b>(IMPORTANT: You MUST use version 1.2.15 satellites!)</b>.</li>
<li>Split the documentation and standalone satellite projects into separate projects. As of version 1.2.15, they will have their own tracking.</li>
<li>Made a slight change in the default "weekday" sort. Won't make a difference anywhere but NYC, maybe. The "neighborhood" now sorts after start time.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 1.2.14* ** <em>- October 31, 2009</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Added a new behavior for the search map. If the map starts off with a zoom less than 8, the first click brings the zoom to 8, then the next click finds meetings. This helps for maps that cover wide areas. It shouldn't affect any of the implementations to date.</li>
<li>Fixed <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=2888335&amp;group_id=228122&amp;atid=1073410">a bug</a>, in which the overlay did not properly follow the marker in advanced search mode.</li>
<li>Made "Location" into "Location Name", and "Location Information" into "Additional Location Information" for the default meeting data fields. Bit more self-explanatory.</li>
<li>Added a language parameter for the standalone satellite server.</li>
<li>Removed the "Secondary Parent" capability. The code is still there, and commented out, but it was too confusing. A basic hierarchy, with assigned additional editors is much simpler.</li>
<li>Fixed <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&amp;aid=2889829&amp;group_id=228122&amp;atid=1073410">a bug</a>, in which setting a "Parent" Service Body to none failed.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 1.2.13* ** <em>- October 27, 2009</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&amp;atid=1073410&amp;aid=2886043&amp;group_id=228122">a bug</a> in the main server and the standalone satellite, in which the advanced pane could interfere with the basic pane.</li>
<li>Added a circular overlay to the Advanced Search map. Makes it much more usable.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 1.2.12* ** <em>- October 25, 2009</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Changed the title strings (tool tips) for the map markers to give information about the weekdays, and added one for the center marker.</li>
<li>Forgot to close a &lt;label&gt; element in the advanced search screen. It is now closed.</li>
<li>Simplified this doc page slightly, and added a header.</li>
<li>Spruced up all the Doxygen-generated docs.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 1.2.11* ** <em>- October 23, 2009</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a couple of JavaScript bugs that showed up in good ol' IE8. We can always rely on IE to throw a monkey wrench into the works.</li>
<li>Added an AJAX throbber to the meeting change submit button. The button becomes replaced by a throbber, until the form is refreshed.</li>
<li>Tweaked the default styling for the Advanced Search Type popup to better mesh with the rest of the screen.</li>
<li>The new map marker now pans to the marker.</li>
<li>Updated the Advanced Search documentation to mention the map.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 1.2.10* ** <em>- October 20, 2009</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Made the contact form textarea slightly smaller, in order to prevent an ugly "stretch."</li>
<li>Now make absolutely sure that there's something to write out for location info, so empty parentheses aren't shown.</li>
<li>Changed the background color of the contact form to be a bit more consistent with its container.</li>
<li>Fixed a broken div container in the main root server interface (did not cause any problems, but we HATES invalid pages. HATESSSS them. NASSSTY invalid pages &lt;gollum/&gt;).</li>
<li>Made the Advanced Search tab able to use the map. This is big juju.</li>
<li>Made the "No Results" display on the root server show up as white.</li>
<li>There was a problem with PDF dumps being corrupted by embedded linefeeds. The BMLT replaces linefeeds with "; " now.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 1.2.9* ** <em>- October 18, 2009</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a minor IE6 bug, in which the response to the contact form submission would trigger a JS error.</li>
<li>Made the center marker of a single meeting details display the black center marker, and now ensure that it is not clickable. This was a usability issue.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 1.2.8* ** <em>- October 17, 2009</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that was causing issues with the Contact form of the FSRNA server.</li>
<li>Further simplified the "Single Meeting" URL.</li>
<li>Fixed a warning in the contact sent screen.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in which Meeting ID searches weren't being done properly (This really only affects administrative use).</li>
<li>Made it so that a single meeting ID search when logged in as an admin, results in a list search, as opposed to a single meeting search. This is because you can't edit meetings in single meeting mode. The list search is a list of one meeting.</li>
<li>Changed the contact email to have a direct link to the root server, instead of the client satellite.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 1.2.7* ** <em>- October 8, 2009</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug in the satellite server that caused problems when doing list searches from the advanced search.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the "More Details" view, in which the GPS POI download link was broken.</li>
<li>Fixed an annoying habit the tabs in the search spec had of toggling the map visibility.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 1.2.6* ** <em>- October 6, 2009</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Removed some more extraneous parameters from the "one meeting" URL. It should be as simple as possible.</li>
<li>Fixed the styling of the center marker info window.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the root server installer wizard that produced a broken config file (Sorry).</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with the way the standalone satellite does its PDF dumps.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 1.2.5* ** <em>- October 3, 2009</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug, in which a certain filtered map search list view link did not work.</li>
<li>Fixed some bugs in the satellite implementations of the contact form.</li>
<li>Did some formatting work to allow more flexibility with the list display.</li>
<li>Added the ability to specify 'advanced' in the 'start_view' parameter, which will open the search specification in the Advanced Tab.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 1.2.4* ** <em>- October 1, 2009</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a VERY strange Joomla! bug. If there is a multi-page reply in list form, then Joomla croaks when it hits a 'style="display:none"' in one of the two hidden &lt;div&gt; elements at the top of the page. I worked around it by setting the hides via JS. What a kludge...</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 1.2.3* ** <em>- September 26, 2009</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Adjusted the XML output for the Service Body query, in order to accommodate CMS plugin satellites.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in which the class specifier for no results was broken.</li>
<li>Added a class definition for no results.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 1.2.2* ** <em>- September 17, 2009</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug, in which the AJAX handler could fail on some implementations (most embarrassingly, the demo implementation for our satellite server).</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 1.2.1* ** <em>- September 14, 2009</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Added a link to a Service Body site, if a URI is provided. This is in the meeting details form.</li>
<li>Added the capability to specify "pre-checked" Service Body checkboxes in the main server Advanced Search tab. However, we still need to add support for this in the plugin satellites.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 1.2* ** <em>- September 7, 2009</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Added a US-Letter-Sized list option to the printable PDF.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in which clicking on page numbers in the list resulted in an unexpected return to map view.</li>
<li>Fixed <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=2845523&amp;group_id=228122&amp;atid=1073410">a bug</a>, in which entering ampersand (&amp;) characters in any of the fields in the editors caused pretty big problems.</li>
<li>Fixed <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&amp;aid=2792463&amp;group_id=228122&amp;atid=1073410">a bug</a>, in which deleted Service bodies with nested components weren't updated properly. The 'fix' is kind of a kludge, as we simply reload the page.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 1.2b2* ** <em>- September 7, 2009</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Added a "busy throbber" to the AJAX contact form, and fixed a couple of bugs that only showed when bad input was entered for the form.</li>
<li>Made the booklet a true "chapbook" size, and started work on a full US letter list.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 1.2b1* ** <em>- September 6, 2009</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Made the booklet PDF use a two-column format.</li>
<li>Added a "Contact Us" email form to each meeting, allowing people to send an email to the administrator for a given meeting.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 1.2b0* ** <em>- September 1, 2009</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for a basic, standalone-satellite-based PDF generator (booklet).</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 1.1.2* ** <em>- August 31, 2009</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Moving all documentation, including the user and admin manual, into the docs directory, and created a frameset to display them.</li>
<li>Tweaked the Doxygen docs to reflect the new structure.</li>
<li>Fixed <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=2846972&amp;group_id=228122&amp;atid=1073410">a bug</a>, in which the list wasn't working in Map view.</li>
<li>Fixed an unreported bug, in which zooming the map caused JavaScript slowdowns.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 1.1.1* ** <em>- July 26, 2009</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Added printout handlers for the six New York meeting lists.</li>
<li>Added some base classes and handlers to the satellite server to afford on-the-fly PDF generation.</li>
<li>Split up the project structure: Moving the Drupal, WordPress and Joomla! modules off into their own projects. The main satellite server will now only be the standalone and PDF generators.</li>
<li>Modified the CSV data export to better accommodate list printing.</li>
<li>Added the ability to do searches, based upon a single key/value (example: county or town).</li>
<li>Fixed <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&amp;aid=2827219&amp;group_id=228122&amp;atid=1073410">a bug</a>, in which map searches with filters didn't work properly when called from a satellite server.</li>
<li>Marked <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=2791321&amp;group_id=228122&amp;atid=1073410">a bug</a> as closed. Not sure how it was fixed (Hate it when that happens).</li>
<li>The current server version is now discretely displayed at the bottom, right corner of the search specification screen for the main server.</li>
<li>Optimized the standalone satellite server to be even more crazy simple to implement, and wrote up some detailed docs on it.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 1.1* ** <em>- July 6, 2009</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Added the ability to dump results as a CSV file. If you are logged in as an admin (to the Root Server), you will have a new choice for return format: CSV file.</li>
<li>Added the ability to retrieve formats as a CSV file as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 1.0.1* ** <em>- June 26, 2009</em></p>
<ul>

<li>Fixed <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=2812707&amp;group_id=228122&amp;atid=1073410">a bug</a>, in which the meeting edit functions did not work in Map View.</li>
</ul>

<li>Added a new field to the three CMS plugins, that allows you to specify a specific URL for the "New Search" link.</li>
<li>Fixed an old bug in the Joomla! plugin that prevented the support older browsers functionality from working properly.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Version 1.0RC5* ** <em>- June 21, 2009</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Removed the Spanish localization. It was not complete, and was only there for testing. It should not be distributed.</li>
<li>Added a couple of notes to the <a href="../main_server/AdminManual/">Admin Manual</a> about the user interface issues that affect creating new users or Service Bodies, or deleting Service Bodies with nested Service Bodies.</li>
<li>Broke the styles out from inside the WordPress plugin, and put them in their own stylesheet. This makes tweaking them easier.</li>
<li>Made the styles for the WordPress plugin far more specific, in an effort to enforce the appearance in a chaotic environment.</li>
<li>Fixed <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=2809609&amp;group_id=228122&amp;atid=1073410">a bug</a>, in which the '&amp;' character caused issues with editing meetings. Addressed the same issue with format editing.</li>

<li>Addressed an issue in which slashes could be added to text field value display in the meeting editor.</li>
<li>Disabled the change rollback feature for meetings. It isn't working properly, and the fix would be too drastic at this stage.</li>

<ul>
<li>Changed the name of the WordPress plugin, as it is now available from <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/bmlt-wordpress-satellite-plugin/">WordPress.org</a>. This means that any prior installs need to first, deactivate, then reinstall and reactivate the new plugin. However, after this, it will be able to be auto-updated.</li>

<li>Added a note to the last page of the install wizard, instructing the server admin to create first a Service Body Admin, then a Service Body, then meetings.</li>
<li>Added a style to the satellite implementations to ensure that the single meeting header starts off at a manageable size.</li>
<li>Slightly tweaked the CSS in the WordPress style to keep the "New Search" menu centered.</li>
<li>Fixed <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=2805918&amp;group_id=228122&amp;atid=1073410">a bug</a>, in which a long/lat of 0 was considered a valid location, even though it is the ocean off of Africa. 0,0 is now considered an empty long/lat.</li>

<li>Fixed <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=2800165&amp;group_id=228122&amp;atid=1073410">a bug</a>, in which we need to append the state to the town in List View.</li>

<li>Bundled a "raw" root server into a single <a href="http://comdef.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/comdef/tags/1.0b4/main_server.zip">downloadable zip file</a>.</li>

<ul>

<p>***Version 1.0b1* ** <em>- May 31, 2009</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Tweaked the CSS for the plugins to give a smoother user experience.</li>
<li>Greatly simplified the URIs. The long URIs were causing problems with some servers.</li>

<li>Fixed a bug in the WordPress plugin that gave the wrong URI for the "New Search."</li>

<li>Fixed a bug in the create new meeting script that set the wrong weekday.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the create new meeting script that was also caused by the rearrangement.</li>

<li>Fixed a bug that prevented the edit window from being properly refreshed after a revert.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug, in which opening a new meeting details page while an edit window was up covered the edit window, and looked awful. The edit window is now closed.</li>
<li>Wrote an Administration Manual.</li>
<li>Fixed a silly bug in which the login check would erroneously flag a failure.</li>

<li>Fixed a couple of more admin bugs introduced by the new setup for a standalone server.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that was introduced by a lame attempt to spackle over another bug. Let this be a lesson: ALWAYS FIX IT -DON'T WORKAROUND!</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in which the proper JavaScript AJAX URIs were not being set up because of the new indirect index. This only affected control panel admin operations.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://comdef.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/comdef/trunk/satellite_server/drupal/">Drupal Module</a> is done.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://comdef.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/comdef/trunk/satellite_server/joomla/">Joomla Module</a> is done.</li>

</ul>
<p>***Version 1.0a5* ** <em>- May 21, 2009</em></p>
<ul>

<li>Fixed some bugs in the presentation of the "Deleted Meetings" panel in the control panel.</li>
<li>The frameset was raised above the main server. The main_server directory now comprises a full administrative site application.</li>
<li>Moved the simple PHP for the satellite server up a level, and set the configuration to reach over to the main server. This makes the satellite_server directory a full standalone meeting search for the local server.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused bad links to single meetings in the headers of details opened from list view.</li>
<li>Added full options for the Joomla! component. It now works in exactly the same way as does the WordPress plugin.</li>

</ul>
<p>***Version 1.0a4* ** <em>- May 17, 2009</em></p>

<li>Fixed a bug in the WordPress plugin that didn't record zoom changes properly in the admin</li>
<li>Removed the "Display Map Search As Whole Page" option from the WordPress plugin. Requires too much CSS intervention on the part of the implementor.</li>
<li>Found and fixed an unnoticed bug that would affect attempts to localize the server.</li>
<li>Added an "admin bar" that allows access to the various admin areas when logged in as an admin.</li>
<li>Fixed a number of JavaScript issues for logged-in admins.</li>
<li>Fixed some IE6 issues (STILL NOT FIXED: Clicking a Region checkbox in Advanced Search does not visibly affect enclosed checkboxes).</li>
<li>Added the meta tag <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc817574.aspx">as recommended by Microsoft</a>, to correct for IE8 deficiencies.</li>
</ul>
