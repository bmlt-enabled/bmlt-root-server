DESCRIPTION
-----------

The Basic Meeting List Toolbox (BMLT, hereafter) is a very powerful client/server system
that has been written for a very specific purpose, for a very specific clientele.

It is designed to track and locate Narcotics Anonymous meetings, which are regularly-scheduled, weekly, recurring events.

The original intended clientele is Narcotics Anonymous Service bodies (although other 12 step fellowships have started
using BMLT as well). The service body implements a BMLT server, and provides the server to other NA Service bodies.
This project is the "root" server for the BMLT. It is the "server" part of the BMLT "client/server" architecture.

You can find out more about the BMLT on the [website](https://bmlt.app).

There are also links to various predecessor legacy repositories [here](#older-repositories) at the end of this README.
For specific information on setting up a development environment for work on the BMLT root server, please
