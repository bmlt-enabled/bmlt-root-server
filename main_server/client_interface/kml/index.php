/**     \file   client_interface/kml/index.php

    \brief  This file is a very simple interface that is designed to return
    a KML (Keyhole Markup Language) string, in response to a search.
    In order to use this, you need to call: <ROOT SERVER BASE URI>/client_interface/kml/
    with the same parameters that you would send to an advanced search. The results
    will be returned as an KML file.

    This file can be called from other servers.

    This file is part of the Basic Meeting List Toolbox (BMLT).
