/**     \file   js_stripper.php

    \brief  This file reads in a JavaScript file, and optimizes it by stripping
    out comments and whitespace. It will also try to GZ compress the output
    using the standard OB functions. It can make a HUGE difference in size.

    The way it works is that you call it from the <link/> element (don't
    specify a "type" attribute), and give it a GET parameter of filename,
    which will equal the file path to the JavaScript file.

    For security purposes, the file must always be a ".js" file, and you can't
    go out of the directory in which this file is located.

    This file is part of the Basic Meeting List Toolbox (BMLT).
